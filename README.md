# Side Projects 

**Go** - Having played Go for many years, I wanted to implement a working Go board similar to the ones I play on online. The rules, including ko, are implemented, but scoring is unfortunately manual at the moment. 

**Poker Simulation** - In the chapter on Monte Carlo in Numerical Methods by Greenbarum and Chartier, there is a MATLAB script that simulates two poker hands playing against each other and determines the winner. I write my own version in Python, which can be used to estimate the winning percentage of one hand against another. 

**Pokemon Type Classification** - In competitive Pokemon, different types are known for different strengths and weaknesses. A Pokemon's utility can be gleaned from its stats. Therefore, I wanted to see if it was possible to determine a Pokemon's type by the distribution of its stats. I took data of the 721 Pokemon from the first 6 generation from Kaggle and analyzed it with a few algorithms.
